"I like to use my phones to watch videos while eating, and I often make video chats with my friends and families. "
Holding a phone all the time is too tiring so I would need a phone holder. 
"Aluminum Can  Shape  Before watching the video, I did not understand why the engineers choose to build cans in cylinder shapes, it never really occurred to me that the small can has so much magical, amazing design philosophies inside! "
Why not use ball-shaped for building cans? 
"It has the smallest amount of material of building a container, the distance of pressure reaching the inner surface are the same. "
The dome at the button  The button is domed to save the material for creating the can and it allows the can to stand more pressure from the outside. 
"Since I bought lots of diet coke to drink, so I've curious about the number stamped on the button, but now I know that it represents something. "
"The left number is the production line, the right number is the body maker number, they help troubleshoot production problems. "
"Decoration  The outside decoration of the can is colorful and easy to notice, but I didn't know there was a inner layer: There is a layer called epoxy lacquer prevents the drinks to have a metallic taste and the acids in the beverage from sabotaging the aluminium  Tabs  I did not realized that tab itself has its own history and has such brilliant design. "
"The can did not have cans before, people needed a special opener to crack it and drink from. "
"The tab then was developed in the 1960s, but the tab needs to be removed entirely from the can. "
And the tab has sharp edges that could easily hurt other people. 
So the stay-on tab was invented. 
"Fun fact  1,5000 cans are being produced worldwide every second  Summary  The video really gave me a strong insight into the components, designs and techniques of building the can. "
It was extremely appealing and  one of the best videos I've seen. 
"As for how I made the can stable, I did two things: first, I used superglue to make sure the upper part does not fall off from the can. "
"Then I realised that the empty can is too light to stand on the table, so I went downstairs and collect some sand to make it heavier to hold the phone. "
"But it is not as stable as I expected, sometimes when the phone is on the box, the entire holder would fall. "
"To add more stability, I would add another can, and use the two cans on both sides as pillars instead of in the middle of the box. "
Another improvement I would make is to add a little bar to the front of the box to keep the phone sliding off from the box.
